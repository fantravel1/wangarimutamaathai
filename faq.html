                            <p>Wangari Maathai was born on <strong>April 1, 1940</strong>, in <strong>Ihithe village, Nyeri District</strong>, in the central highlands of Kenya.</p>
                            <p>She grew up in a rural farming community surrounded by lush forests and fertile lands. This early connection with nature deeply influenced her later environmental activism. The forests she knew as a child were later devastated by deforestation, which motivated her to found the Green Belt Movement.</p>
